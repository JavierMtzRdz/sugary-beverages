# Notes



## EDA:

 - We will plot the results with the trend and explain that. 



## Formal Analysis

#### Data preparation (Javier)

* Modification of the data. 
  * Remove pre-intervention. 
  * Recode follows as a control for the first data
  * Should we remove the washout? Yes
  * Create since the start of the intervention

#### ANCONA (Henry)

* Definition
* Assumption
* Any 

#### LME (Son)

* Definition
* Assumption
* Any 

#### Recommendation (together)

* Check assumptions post-running (Henry)

1. Did the interventions lead to increases in zero-calorie beverages and/or
   decreases in sugary beverages?
1. Do the effects differ by site?
1. Does the combination of interventions lead to larger effects?
1. Does the calorie-equivalent messaging have a larger impact than the simple
   calorie admonishment?
