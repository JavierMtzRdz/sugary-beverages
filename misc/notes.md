## EDA:

 - We will plot the results with the trend and explain that. 



## Formal Analysis

#### Pre-analysis preparation (Javier)

Before conducting the statistical analysis, it is important to address some elements that were identified during the Exploratory Analysis that could potentially impact our analysis. These include the weekly effect, different lengths of the pre-intervention observations, and unnecessary information. Firstly, we aim to capture the intervention effects and not the number of day's effects. Therefore, we can remove the weekly impact by either using a percentage of sales or decomposing the time series, as identified in the Exploratory Analysis, and removing the seasonal variation. While the percentage approach may be easier, it is recommended to use the decomposition method as the variable containing the total items sold may have inconsistencies that suggest unreliable information. For example, day 199 in the NS site has more zero-calorie and sugary beverages sold than total items, and days 50-53, 107, 184, and 196 in the NS site have decimals.

Secondly, as sites two and three have a short pre-intervention period, it is necessary to compensate for the missing information. This can be done by combining the follow-up and pre-intervention categories into a new category that will serve as the baseline for the study. Lastly, we are not interested in the washout periods that are used to reduce the effects of previous interventions. Hence, this data can be ignored in the study.

 Recodification and the demotion of unnecessary information. 

* Modification of the data. 
  * Remove pre-intervention. 
  * Recode follows as a control for the first data
  * Should we remove the washout? Yes
  * Create since the start of the intervention

* Check assumptions post-running (Henry)

1. Did the interventions lead to increases in zero-calorie beverages and/or
   decreases in sugary beverages?
1. Do the effects differ by site?
1. Does the combination of interventions lead to larger effects?
1. Does the calorie-equivalent messaging have a larger impact than the simple
   calorie admonishment?
