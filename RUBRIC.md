## Rubric

### Format

1. **Introduction** Describe the background of the scientific problem, and clearly 
state the objective(s) of the study. State the statistical questions the client 
wants to answer.
1. **Data description and summaries** How the data were collected? Is it an 
observational study or experiment? What is the sample size? What variables are 
measured and how they are measured (e.g., continuous data or categorical data, 
units of measurements)? Any missing data?
1. **Exploratory analysis** Suggest appropriate tables and figures for summarizing
the data, such as boxplots or scatterplots.
1. **Formal analysis** Suggest formal statistical models and methods to confirm 
the pre- liminary conclusions from exploratory analysis, such as regression 
models. Keep mathematical equations at minimum.
1. **Conclusions** Summarize your recommendations to the clients.
1. **References** References cited in your report and appropriate references your 
client can understand for further reading. These _must_ be formatted properly. I
suggest using BibTeX or following the instructions 
[here](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/jupyterlab.html#citations).
1. **Statistical Appendix** You can put mathematical formulas here. _NO CODE_. 
You can also put additional tables/figures here. This _must_ still read like a
document. Organize it into subsections as necessary (possibly following the 
same instructions as above).

### Best practices

* Write in a language that client can easily understand. Avoid technical 
details. Use examples and figures to explain or illustrate.
* Do not put computer code or output anywhere.
* Explain key concepts and ideas in easy-to-understand language. Do not refer 
the client to references for explanations before giving your own.
* The captions of graphs and tables should be self-contained enough so that the 
meaning is clear without reading the body of the report.
* Use 11 or 12 point sizes.
* The main text of the report should include only the most essential tables 
and figures. 
* Put additional tables and figures in Appendix.
* Title and authors: Choose a reasonable title. Don't call it "Sugary Beverages"
or "Homework 2". 
* You must open your PR by midnight on the due date.


### Peer-evaluation guidance

* Please be as detailed as possible. 
* Use the PR review functionality to its fullest.
* Comment on individual lines as well as providing overall assessments.
* "Approve" the PR to indicate that you are done.
* Don't just echo the comments of the other reviewers.
* Please consider the following criteria for peer evaluation: 
  a. If you were a non-statistican client, can you understand the report easily?
  a. Are you convinced by the authorâ€™s explanations? 
  a. Is the writing clear and easy to follow? Any writing problems or typos or grammar errors?
