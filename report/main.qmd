## Introduction

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Data Description and Summaries

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Exploratory Analysis

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:



## Formal analysis

#### Difference-in-Difference Estimation

DID, or Difference-in-Differences, is a quasi-experimental method that utilizes longitudinal data from treatment and control groups. This approach is particularly effective in this design, as it aligns with the quasi-experimental nature of the study. This method aims to create a suitable counterfactual for estimating causal effects by comparing changes over time between the groups. The key assumption behind DID is that in the absence of the treatment, the average change in the outcome for the treatment group would have been the same as the average change for the control group.
